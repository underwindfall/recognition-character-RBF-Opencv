# recognition_character_RBF_Opencv

In this part, we need to create an application to learn and Recognize the hexadecimal codes (0-9 and A-F) with a raspicam under the
Raspberry Pi. We then begin development from the application of Network library rbf fanned by global-sensing. In order to facilitate interfacing between the Program and the bookshop, we decided to develop our program in C ++ in Using the "cmake", "make" and "powerful" tools to make The "Opencv" image processing.<br/>
